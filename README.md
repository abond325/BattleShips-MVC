<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>The challenge is to program a simple version of the game Battleships. Create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of Battleships against ships placed by the computer.</p>

<p>The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1x Battleship (5 squares)</li>
  <li>2x Destroyers (4 squares)</li>
</ul>
  
<p>The player enters coordinates of the form “A5”, where "A" is the column and "5" is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.</p>

<p>You can write a console application or UI to complete the task.</p?

<p>Try to code the challenge as you would approach any typical work task; we are not looking for you to show knowledge of frameworks or unusual programming language features. Most importantly, keep it simple.</p>

<h3><strong>Build & Run</strong></h3>
<p>Build the BattleShipGame solution and then run the BattleshipClient.</p?
