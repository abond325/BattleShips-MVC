<h3>Application Review</h3>

<p>The application in this repository has been developed using test driven development techniques and SOLID design principles.</p>

<p>The BattleShipMVC project is incomplete. When complete this project should provide the same functionality as the BattleShipClient project but using an Asp.Net MVC application instead of a Console application.</p>

<p>Demonstrate your understanding of this application by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Writing a brief critique that assesses how the application either meets or could be modified to meet SOLID design principles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a short scoping document that details the high level development tasks required to implement the BattleShipMVC project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
